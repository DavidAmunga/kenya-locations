## Usage

### Basic Usage

You can use the standalone functions directly:

```typescript
import {
  getAllCounties,
  county,
  getAllConstituencies,
  getConstituencyByCode,
  getAllWards,
  getWardByCode,
  getAllWardsInCounty,
  getCountyOfWard,
  search,
  getAllSubCounties,
  getSubCountyByCode,
  getSubCountiesInCounty,
  getCountyOfSubCounty,
  getWardsInSubCounty,
} from "kenya-locations";

// Get all counties
const allCounties = getAllCounties();

// Get a specific county by name or code
const mombasa = county("Mombasa"); // or county('001')

// Get all constituencies
const constituencies = getAllConstituencies();

// Get a specific constituency by code
const changamwe = getConstituencyByCode("290");

// Get all wards
const wards = getAllWards();

// Get a specific ward by code
const ward = getWardByCode("123");

// Get all wards in a county
const wardsInMombasa = getAllWardsInCounty("001");

// Get the county a ward belongs to
const wardCounty = getCountyOfWard("123");

// Search across all administrative levels
const results = search("Nairob", 10);

// Get all sub-counties
const allSubCounties = getAllSubCounties();

// Get a specific sub-county by code
const subCounty = getSubCountyByCode("123");

// Get all sub-counties in a county
const subCountiesInMombasa = getSubCountiesInCounty("001");

// Get the county a sub-county belongs to
const subCountyCounty = getCountyOfSubCounty("123");

// Get all wards in a sub-county
const wardsInSubCounty = getWardsInSubCounty("123");
```

### Chainable API

The package provides a chainable API for navigating the administrative hierarchy:

```typescript
import { county } from "kenya-locations";

// Get a county and its constituencies
const mombasa = county("Mombasa");
const constituencies = mombasa?.constituencies();

// Get a specific constituency in a county
const changamwe = mombasa?.constituency("Changamwe");

// Get wards in a constituency
const wards = changamwe?.wards();

// Get a specific ward in a constituency
const ward = changamwe?.ward("Port Reitz");
```

### Fuzzy Search

The package includes a powerful fuzzy search feature to find locations even with typos or partial matches:

```typescript
import { search } from "kenya-locations";

// Search across all administrative levels
const results = search("Nairob");
/*
Results:
[
  { type: 'county', item: { code: '047', name: 'Nairobi' } },
  { type: 'constituency', item: { code: '..', name: 'Nairobi North', countyCode: '047' } },
  { type: 'ward', item: { code: '...', name: 'Nairobi West', constituencyCode: '...' } },
  { type: 'sub-county', item: { code: '...', name: 'Nairobi West', countyCode: '047' } }
]
*/
```

### Utility Functions

```typescript
import {
  getAllWardsInCounty,
  getCountyOfWard,
  getWardsInConstituency,
  getCountyOfConstituency,
  getSubCountiesInCounty,
  getCountyOfSubCounty,
  getWardsInSubCounty,
} from "kenya-locations";

// Get all wards in a county
const wardsInMombasa = getAllWardsInCounty("001");

// Get the county a ward belongs to
const county = getCountyOfWard("0001");

// Get all wards in a constituency
const wardsInConstituency = getWardsInConstituency("290");

// Get the county a constituency belongs to
const constituencyCounty = getCountyOfConstituency("290");

// Get all sub-counties in a county
const subCountiesInMombasa = getSubCountiesInCounty("001");

// Get the county a sub-county belongs to
const subCountyCounty = getCountyOfSubCounty("001001");

// Get all wards in a sub-county
const wardsInSubCounty = getWardsInSubCounty("001001");
```
