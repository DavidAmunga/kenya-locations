## Hierarchy

The library supports the complete Kenyan administrative hierarchy:

```
County (47 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Locality (e.g., Westlands, Embakasi)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Area (e.g., Gigiri, Karen C)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sub-County
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Constituency (e.g., Westlands)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ward (e.g., Mountain View)
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

You can use the standalone functions directly:

```typescript
import {
  getCounties,
  county,
  getConstituencies,
  getConstituencyByCode,
  getWards,
  getWardsInCounty,
  getCountyOfWard,
  search,
  getSubCounties,
  getSubCountiesInCounty,
  getCountyOfSubCounty,
  getWardsInSubCounty,
  getLocalities,
  getAreas,
  getLocalityByName,
  getAreaByName,
  getLocalitiesInCounty,
  getAreasInLocality,
  getAreasInCounty,
  getCountyOfLocality,
  getCountyOfArea,
  getLocalityOfArea,
  locality,
} from "kenya-locations";

// Get all counties
const allCounties = getCounties();

// Get a specific county by name or code
const mombasa = county("Mombasa"); // or county('001')

// Get all constituencies
const constituencies = getConstituencies();

// Get a specific constituency by code
const changamwe = getConstituencyByCode("290");
// Access county information directly from constituency
console.log(changamwe?.county.name); // "Mombasa"
console.log(changamwe?.county.code); // "001"

// Get all wards
const wards = getWards();

// Get all wards in a county
const wardsInMombasa = getWardsInCounty("001");

// Get the county a ward belongs to
const wardCounty = getCountyOfWard("0001");

// Get all sub-counties
const allSubCounties = getSubCounties();

// Get all sub-counties in a county (supports both name and code)
const subCountiesInMombasa = getSubCountiesInCounty("Mombasa"); // by name
const subCountiesInMombasaByCode = getSubCountiesInCounty("001"); // by code

// Get the county a sub-county belongs to
const subCountyCounty = getCountyOfSubCounty("subCountyName");

// Get all wards in a sub-county
const wardsInSubCounty = getWardsInSubCounty("subCountyCode");
```

### Working with Localities and Areas

```typescript
import {
  getLocalities,
  getAreas,
  getLocalityByName,
  getAreaByName,
  getLocalitiesInCounty,
  getAreasInLocality,
  getAreasInCounty,
  getCountyOfLocality,
  getCountyOfArea,
  getLocalityOfArea,
  locality,
} from "kenya-locations";

// Get all localities
const allLocalities = getLocalities();

// Get all areas
const allAreas = getAreas();

// Get a specific locality by name
const westlands = getLocalityByName("Westlands");
console.log(westlands?.county); // "Nairobi"

// Get a specific area by name
const gigiri = getAreaByName("Gigiri");
console.log(gigiri?.locality); // "Westlands"
console.log(gigiri?.county); // "Nairobi"

// Get all localities in a county
const nairobiLocalities = getLocalitiesInCounty("Nairobi");

// Get all areas in a locality
const westlandsAreas = getAreasInLocality("Westlands");

// Get all areas in a county
const nairobiAreas = getAreasInCounty("Nairobi");

// Find parent entities
const areaCounty = getCountyOfArea("Gigiri"); // County object
const areaLocality = getLocalityOfArea("Gigiri"); // Locality object
const localityCounty = getCountyOfLocality("Westlands"); // County object

// Get locality with optional county filter
const westlandsInNairobi = locality("Westlands", "Nairobi");
const anyWestlands = locality("Westlands"); // First match
```

### Chainable API

The package provides a chainable API for navigating the administrative hierarchy:

```typescript
import { county, getLocalityByName } from "kenya-locations";

// Working with Counties
const nairobi = county("Nairobi");

// Get constituencies in a county
const constituencies = nairobi?.constituencies();

// Get a specific constituency in a county
const westlands = nairobi?.constituency("Westlands");

// Get localities in a county
const localities = nairobi?.localities();

// Get a specific locality in a county
const embakasi = nairobi?.locality("Embakasi");

// Get areas in a county
const areas = nairobi?.areas();

// Get areas in a specific locality within a county
const westlandsAreas = nairobi?.areasByLocality("Westlands");

// Access county information directly from constituency
console.log(westlands?.county.name); // "Nairobi"
console.log(westlands?.county.code); // "047"

// Get wards in a constituency
const wards = westlands?.wards();

// Get a specific ward in a constituency
const ward = westlands?.ward("Mountain View");

// Working with Localities
const westlandsLocality = getLocalityByName("Westlands");

// Get all areas in this locality
const areas = westlandsLocality?.areas();

// Get a specific area in the locality
const gigiri = westlandsLocality?.area("Gigiri");

// Get the county this locality belongs to
const county = westlandsLocality?.getCounty();
```

### Search Functionality

The package includes a powerful fuzzy search feature that works across all administrative levels:

```typescript
import { search } from "kenya-locations";

// Search across all administrative levels
const results = search("Westlands");
/*
Results include:
[
  { type: 'locality', item: { name: 'Westlands', county: 'Nairobi' } },
  { type: 'constituency', item: { code: '290', name: 'Westlands', county: { code: '047', name: 'Nairobi' } } },
  { type: 'area', item: { name: 'Gigiri', locality: 'Westlands', county: 'Nairobi' } },
  // ... more results
]
*/

// Search for areas
const areaResults = search("Gigiri");
/*
Results:
[
  { type: 'area', item: { name: 'Gigiri', locality: 'Westlands', county: 'Nairobi' } }
]
*/

// Search with limit
const limitedResults = search("Nairobi", 5); // Maximum 5 results

// Search handles typos and partial matches
const typoResults = search("Nairob"); // Still finds Nairobi-related locations
```

### Complete Hierarchy Navigation Example

```typescript
import { county, getAreaByName, getLocalityOfArea, getCountyOfArea } from "kenya-locations";

// Start from county and drill down
const nairobi = county("Nairobi");
const westlands = nairobi?.locality("Westlands");
const gigiri = westlands?.area("Gigiri");

console.log(`Found: ${gigiri.name} in ${gigiri.locality}, ${gigiri.county}`);

// Start from area and go up the hierarchy
const area = getAreaByName("Gigiri");
const locality = getLocalityOfArea("Gigiri");
const county = getCountyOfArea("Gigiri");

console.log(`Hierarchy: ${county?.name} ‚Üí ${locality?.name} ‚Üí ${area?.name}`);
// Output: "Hierarchy: Nairobi ‚Üí Westlands ‚Üí Gigiri"
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
import { county, getLocalityByName, NotFoundError } from "kenya-locations";

try {
  const nairobi = county("Nairobi");
  const locality = nairobi?.locality("NonExistentLocality");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    console.log("Locality not found:", error.message);
  }
}

try {
  const westlands = getLocalityByName("Westlands");
  const area = westlands?.area("NonExistentArea");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    console.log("Area not found:", error.message);
  }
}
```
