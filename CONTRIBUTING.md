## üéØ Overview

The Kenya Locations library maintains data for Kenya's administrative divisions in a hierarchical
structure:

```
County (47 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sub-County
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Constituency
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ward
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Locality
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Area
```

All data is stored in TypeScript files in the `lib/data/` directory and follows strict typing and
formatting conventions.

## üìä Data Structure

### Counties (`lib/data/counties.ts`)

Counties are the top-level administrative divisions. Each county has:

```typescript
interface County {
  code: string; // Official county code (e.g., "047")
  name: string; // Official county name (e.g., "Nairobi")
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
{ code: "047", name: "Nairobi" }
```

### Sub-Counties (`lib/data/sub-counties.ts`)

Sub-counties are administrative divisions within counties:

```typescript
interface SubCounty {
  code: string; // Unique sub-county code
  name: string; // Official sub-county name
  county: string; // County name (must match exactly)
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
{ code: "04701", name: "Westlands", county: "Nairobi" }
```

### Constituencies (`lib/data/constituencies.ts`)

Constituencies are electoral divisions within counties:

```typescript
interface Constituency {
  code: string; // Official constituency code
  name: string; // Official constituency name
  county: County; // Reference to county object
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
{ code: "290", name: "Westlands", county: counties[29] } // counties[29] is Nairobi
```

### Wards (`lib/data/wards.ts`)

Wards are the smallest electoral units within constituencies:

```typescript
interface Ward {
  code: string; // Official ward code
  name: string; // Official ward name
  constituency: string; // Constituency name (must match exactly)
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
{ code: "1437", name: "Mountain View", constituency: "Westlands" }
```

### Localities (`lib/data/locality.ts`)

Localities are geographic/administrative areas within counties:

```typescript
interface Locality {
  name: string; // Locality name
  county: string; // County name (must match exactly)
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
{ name: "Westlands", county: "Nairobi" }
```

### Areas (`lib/data/area.ts`)

Areas are specific neighborhoods or zones within localities:

```typescript
interface Area {
  name: string; // Area name
  locality: string; // Locality name (must match exactly)
  county: string; // County name (must match exactly)
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
{ name: "Gigiri", locality: "Westlands", county: "Nairobi" }
```

## ‚ûï Adding New Data

> üìã **Quick Reference**: Check out our [Data Template](templates/data-template.md) for copy-paste
> examples and common mistakes to avoid.

### 1. Counties

To add a new county (rare, as Kenya has 47 fixed counties):

1. Open `lib/data/counties.ts`
2. Add the county to the array with the correct code and name
3. Ensure the code follows the official format
4. Update any dependent data files

### 2. Sub-Counties

To add a new sub-county:

1. Open `lib/data/sub-counties.ts`
2. Add the sub-county with:
   - Unique code
   - Official name
   - Exact county name (must match `counties.ts`)

```typescript
{ code: "04702", name: "Dagoretti", county: "Nairobi" }
```

### 3. Constituencies

To add a new constituency:

1. Open `lib/data/constituencies.ts`
2. Import counties: `import { counties } from "./counties";`
3. Add the constituency with:
   - Official constituency code
   - Official name
   - Reference to the correct county object

```typescript
{ code: "291", name: "Dagoretti North", county: counties[29] } // counties[29] = Nairobi
```

**Finding the correct county index:**

- Counties are in alphabetical order in the array
- Nairobi is at index 29 (0-based)
- Check the existing file for the correct index

### 4. Wards

To add a new ward:

1. Open `lib/data/wards.ts`
2. Add the ward with:
   - Official ward code
   - Official name
   - Exact constituency name (must match `constituencies.ts`)

```typescript
{ code: "1438", name: "Kilimani", constituency: "Westlands" }
```

### 5. Localities

To add a new locality:

1. Open `lib/data/locality.ts`
2. Add the locality with:
   - Descriptive name
   - Exact county name (must match `counties.ts`)

```typescript
{ name: "Kilimani", county: "Nairobi" }
```

### 6. Areas

To add a new area:

1. Open `lib/data/area.ts`
2. Add the area with:
   - Specific area name
   - Exact locality name (must match `locality.ts`)
   - Exact county name (must match `counties.ts`)

```typescript
{ name: "Yaya Centre", locality: "Kilimani", county: "Nairobi" }
```

## ‚úÖ Data Validation

### Required Checks

Before submitting your changes, ensure:

1. **Exact Name Matching**: All references between files use exact names

   - County names in sub-counties, localities, and areas must match `counties.ts`
   - Locality names in areas must match `locality.ts`
   - Constituency names in wards must match `constituencies.ts`

2. **Unique Codes**: All codes must be unique within their category

   - County codes are official government codes
   - Constituency codes are official IEBC codes
   - Ward codes are official IEBC codes
   - Sub-county codes should follow a logical pattern

3. **Proper Formatting**:

   - Use double quotes for strings
   - Follow existing indentation (2 spaces)
   - Maintain alphabetical order where applicable
   - No trailing commas on the last item

4. **Official Names**: Use official government names, not colloquial names
   - Check IEBC website for constituencies and wards
   - Check government gazettes for sub-counties
   - Use commonly accepted names for localities and areas

### Example Validation

```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong - name mismatch
{ name: "Gigiri", locality: "Westland", county: "Nairobi" } // "Westland" should be "Westlands"

// ‚úÖ Correct
{ name: "Gigiri", locality: "Westlands", county: "Nairobi" }
```

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
pnpm  test
```

### 3. Validate Data Integrity

We provide a validation script to check your data:

```bash
pnpm run validate
```

This script will:

- ‚úÖ Check for duplicate codes/names within appropriate contexts
- ‚úÖ Verify all references between files are valid
- ‚úÖ Ensure proper data structure
- ‚úÖ Display a summary of all data

**Note**: The script allows duplicate locality names across different counties and duplicate area
names across different localities, as this reflects real-world naming patterns in Kenya.

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses automated pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and data integrity. When you
make a commit, the following will happen automatically:

- **Code Formatting**: ESLint and Prettier will check and fix your code
- **Data Validation**: If you've changed data files, they'll be validated automatically
- **Tests**: The test suite will run to ensure nothing is broken
- **Commit Message**: Your commit message will be checked for conventional format

üìã **Learn More**: See [Pre-commit Hooks Documentation](docs/PRE_COMMIT_HOOKS.md) for detailed
information.

**Example commit messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "data(nairobi): add new localities in Westlands"
git commit -m "feat(search): improve search performance"
git commit -m "fix(validation): handle duplicate names correctly"
```

### 5. Test Search Functionality

Create a simple test file to verify your data works with the search:

```javascript
import { search, getLocalityByName, getAreaByName } from "./dist/index.es.js";

// Test your new locality
const locality = getLocalityByName("YourNewLocality");
console.log(locality);

// Test your new area
const area = getAreaByName("YourNewArea");
console.log(area);

// Test search
const results = search("YourNewLocation");
console.log(results);
```

### 6. Verify Relationships

Ensure all relationships work correctly:

```javascript
import { county } from "./dist/index.es.js";

const nairobi = county("Nairobi");

// Test locality access
const localities = nairobi?.localities();
console.log(localities.find((l) => l.name === "YourNewLocality"));

// Test area access
const areas = nairobi?.areas();
console.log(areas.find((a) => a.name === "YourNewArea"));
```
